One thing you struggled with. I struggled with understanding the vocabulary words.
One thing you understand clearly. I understand the concept of intergers and floats.
What is a variable? A variable i named container that stores value. EX: age = 25, age is the name and 25 is the value store into it.
Basic Data types.
int-->whole numbers (1,5,100)
float-->numers with decimals (3.14,2.5)
str-->text("hello") ex: string
bool-->true or false
Why does input() return a string? Because Python does not assume what type the user is entering.
"25" won't work you have to do int("35")

Today I learned about validation and making a simple project
I assigned variables and used if else to help assign letter grades when 
asking what you got on the test to out put a letter grade.
I was able to get help with this but still need practice to be able to do this
from tmemory. I understand some things but will continue practicing.
